# Headquarters

This is an experimental mod for GZDoom that allows the player to go to another map for a while, and then return back.

Press a key to go to the HQ, press another key to go back, or use normal exit in HQ.

A catch: the "HQ" map must be defined in the same cluster as the map from which you go to HQ, otherwise the state is not saved and a clustertext is displayed.
