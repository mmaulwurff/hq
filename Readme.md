# Headquarters

This is an experimental mod for GZDoom that allows the player to go to another map for a while, and then return back.

To load, [Kinsie's Gameplay Mod Test Map](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=57221) is needed. Load Headquarters after DOOMTEST.wad.

Press a key to go to the HQ, press another key to go back, or use normal exit in HQ.

A catch: the "HQ" map must be defined in the same cluster as the map from which you go to HQ, otherwise the state is not saved and a clustertext is displayed.
